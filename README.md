# google-books

React Google Books is a MERN-stack app that allows users to search for books of interest! Books can be saved to and deleted from the 'favorites' list.

This project was created as an assignment from Penn LPS Coding Bootcamp.

## Assignment Parameters

* This application requires at minimum 2 pages, check out the following mockup images for each page:

  * [Search](client/public/img/readme/Search.png) - User can search for books via the Google Books API and render them here. User has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

  * [Saved](client/public/img/readme/Saved.png) - Renders all books saved to the Mongo database. User has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.

## Getting started
